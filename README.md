# Welcome
Greetings to all developers, and welcome to the repository for CodeBytes. This is where our code will be hosted, and where you'll be doing most of your work.

# Getting Started

## Docker

To start, we'll need to install Docker, a software application that lets you deploy software in "containers". In summary, using Docker means you don't have to reinstall dependencies if you happen to work from multiple devices; just load up the container, and you'll be good to go. 

If you'd like to know more about Docker, please view the following links:

 - [Docker in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjnup-PuquQ) 
 - [100+ Docker Concepts you Need to Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIrNIzy6U_g) 
 - [Docker: Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) </li>

 ### [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) (follow the steps provided in this link)

## How to use it: 

To create the container for the first time, run the following command in the terminal:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

Once you've ran this command, the container should be available for you. Going forward, unless you want to do a fresh reinstall of the container, you won't need to run this command again.
